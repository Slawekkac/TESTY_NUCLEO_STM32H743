# TESTY_NUCLEO_STM32H743
Testing with module NUCLEO STM32H743ZI2

This tests was made in STM32CubeIDE v1.6.0

Project for testing Ethernet and FDCAN:
1. Project "Test_ETH_NUCLEO-STM32H743" is based on the FreeRTOS based on LAN8742A
2. Project "Test2_ETH_NUCLEO-STM32H743" was made without RTOS based on LAN8742A
3. Project "Test3_ETH_NUCLEO-STM32H743" was made without RTOS, with simple webserwer based on LAN8742A
4. Project "Test3_ETH_NUCLEO-STM32H743" was made without RTOS, with simple webserwer based on DP83848
